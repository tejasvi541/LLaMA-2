# LLaMA 2 Implementation from Scratch Using PyTorch

## Overview

This project aims to implement the LLaMA 2 model from scratch using only PyTorch. The implementation utilizes the LLaMA 2 7B weights, which have been downloaded using the LLaMA stack, rather than relying on any external scripts. This repository focuses on building each component of the LLaMA 2 architecture, providing a comprehensive understanding of how this advanced language model functions.

This project is designed to run within Docker containers optimized for PyTorch with GPU support, ensuring a consistent environment for development and deployment. A Dockerfile is included for easy setup.

## Project Components

### 1. Rotary Positional Encoding

Rotary Positional Encoding is a technique used to inject information about the position of tokens in a sequence into the model. Unlike traditional positional encodings that add fixed values to the input embeddings, rotary encodings use rotational transformations to represent positions. This allows the model to better generalize to longer sequences and improves performance on tasks requiring context comprehension.

### 2. KV Cache

The Key-Value (KV) Cache is a mechanism that enhances the efficiency of the transformer model during inference. When processing sequences, the KV Cache stores the key and value vectors computed during the encoding of previous tokens. This allows the model to quickly access relevant information without recalculating these vectors for every new token. This is particularly useful for tasks like text generation, where previous context needs to be retained while generating new tokens.

### 3. RMS Norm

Root Mean Square Layer Normalization (RMS Norm) is a normalization technique that helps stabilize and speed up training by normalizing activations. It computes the square root of the mean of squared activations across features and scales them, reducing internal covariate shift. This normalization helps maintain the gradients within a suitable range, promoting better convergence during training.

### 4. Grouped Multihead Attention

Grouped Multihead Attention is an extension of the traditional multihead attention mechanism, where attention heads are grouped to improve the model's expressiveness while maintaining computational efficiency. By grouping attention heads, the model can focus on different aspects of the input simultaneously, capturing diverse relationships within the data. This is especially useful for processing complex language patterns and improving overall model performance.

## Detailed Implementation

This project includes the following key components, each implemented with detailed explanations:

- **Model Architecture**: A thorough overview of the transformer architecture, including the encoder and decoder components.
